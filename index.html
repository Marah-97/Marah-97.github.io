        <h2>The Dataset</h2>

        <p>
            This analysis draws on two public datasets published by the San Francisco Police Department 
            on the SF Open Data Portal: historical incident reports from 2003 to May 2018, and incident 
            reports from 2018 to the present. After merging and standardizing the two datasets, the 
            combined record spans <strong>22 years</strong> of reported crime across all police districts in the city.
        </p>

        <p>From this combined dataset, we selected seven Personal Focus Crimes:</p>

        <div class="crimes-list">
            <span class="crime-tag">Assault</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Vehicle Theft</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Drug Offences</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Burglary</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Robbery</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Suspicious</span>
            <span class="crime-tag">Sex Offence</span>
        </div>

        <p>
            These crimes were chosen to capture a broad variety of crime types — violent, property-based, 
            and enforcement-driven — so that contrasting trends across categories can reveal something 
            meaningful about how social and policy changes shape the city's crime landscape over time.

            For each Personal Focus Crime, plot the total number of incidents per year from 2003 to 2025.

                Each line represents one crime category. Note the diverging trajectories around 2020 and the

        </div>

        <p>
            Looking across the full 22-year period, the most striking signal is the impact of the 
            COVID-19 pandemic around 2020, which pushed different crime types in sharply opposite directions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Assault dropped noticeably in 2020.</strong> COVID restrictions limited nightlife, 
            public gatherings, and face-to-face interactions, removing many of the everyday situations 
            that lead to interpersonal violence.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Burglary and vehicle theft moved in the opposite direction.</strong> Empty buildings, 
            reduced street activity, and the economic stress of the pandemic all created more opportunities 
            for property crime. This divergence — violent crime down, property crime up — was a pattern 
            documented in many cities during the pandemic period.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Drug offences tell a longer story.</strong> They declined steadily from around 2009 
            until the pandemic, driven by a shift toward treatment over arrest for low-level possession. 
            By 2024, however, recorded drug offences rose above pre-pandemic levels as San Francisco 
            increased enforcement in response to the visible fentanyl crisis. In 2024, the mayor signed 
            legislation allowing police to transport drug users directly to treatment facilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Robbery shows a steady long-term decline</strong> across the entire period. 
            The shift toward cashless payments, widespread smartphone tracking, and increased 
            surveillance have reduced both the opportunity and payoff of robbery over two decades — 
            a trend that continued even during periods of wider social disruption.

        <h2>Crime Profiles by Police District</h2>

        <div class="question">
            For each police district, compute the conditional crime profile ratio 
            r(crime, district) = P(crime | district) / P(crime). A value above 1 means 
            that crime type is over-represented in that district relative to the city-wide average. 
            Visualize these ratios and describe one district whose profile stands out.
        </div>

                districts. Green = over-represented relative to city average (ratio &gt; 1); orange = 
                under-represented (ratio &lt; 1). A value of 1.0 is exactly the city-wide average. 
                Rows are sorted by each district's dominant crime type.

        </div>

        <p>
            Each cell shows how common a crime is in a given district relative to the city-wide average. 
            A value of 1.0 means exactly average; 2.0 means twice as common; 0.5 means half as common. 
            This normalization allows fair comparison across districts of very different sizes and 
            total crime volumes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Tenderloin stands out immediately</strong>, with a drug offences ratio of 3.28 — 
            meaning drug crime is more than three times as common there compared to the city average. 
            At the same time, vehicle theft is heavily under-represented (0.25), which makes sense 
            given that the Tenderloin is a dense, pedestrian-heavy neighborhood with few privately 
            parked vehicles. The city declared a state of emergency in the Tenderloin in late 2021 
            in response to overdose deaths and open-air drug markets — and this data confirms that 
            picture with striking clarity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Out of SF</strong> shows elevated vehicle theft (2.04) and sex offences (1.86), 
            likely reflecting incidents near highways or city boundaries where cars are more vulnerable. 
            <strong>Richmond</strong> and <strong>Taraval</strong> both have elevated burglary ratios 
            (1.42 and 1.24) — quieter residential western neighborhoods with more homes and shops to 
            burglarize but far less street-level drug activity. <strong>Central</strong> and 
            <strong>Northern</strong> show profiles close to 1.0 across most categories, reflecting 
            their mixed tourist and commercial character.

            The most striking pattern is a large cluster of incidents at <strong>minute 0</strong> — 
            far larger than any other minute — indicating that officers frequently round the incident 
            time to the nearest full hour when filing their report. A smaller but visible cluster also 
            appears at <strong>minute 30</strong>, consistent with rounding to the half hour.

            This reveals an important limitation of the data: recorded times should not be treated 
            as exact measurements. For broad hourly patterns this is manageable, but any fine-grained 
            sub-hour analysis would produce misleading results.
